# The Hugo Grayscale theme is a one page theme designed to be the front page to your site.  Its content is populated via the front-matter in content/_index.md.  The page consists of, in order:
# * a navbar at top linking to the other sections, and other arbitrary links
# * an intro section presenting a header title and into text with background image
# * an about section presenting a header and text with black background
# * a download section presenting header and text with background image
# * a contact section presenting header and text with black background
# 
# The section names show up as the links in the navbar, so you may wish to rename them if, for example, you're not using it for the purpose suggested by the default section name.
# 
# The background images are selected by filename - the intro section image must be named "intro-bg.jpg" and placed in the "static/img/" directory for your site.  Similarly, the downloads section image must be named "downloads-bg.jpg" and placed in the "static/img/" directory for your site.  See the default images in the theme's static directory for file size reference.

    text: '<p>Fire fighting has never been more dangerous.</p> <p>Modern construction and materials are creating fires that grow faster and hotter than those of a generation ago.</p> <p>Thanks to improved building codes and better education structure fires are now a low frequency occurrence, but a side effect of this success is that today&#39s firefighters have less experience with structure fires than ever before.</p> <p>These two factors together have the potential for deadly consequences.</p> <p>Nothing can replace live, hands-on training for firefighters, it is absolutely critical to their success.  But there are fire phenomena that are too dangerous to train with or which require large, expensive props which are costly and not readily accessible to most firefighters.</p> <p>Entrain: Fire Dynamics Trainer is envisioned as a Virtual Reality tool to give firefighters the extra knowledge they need to fight today&#39s fires, and to supplement existing live fire training with immersive, realistic, accessible, and cost effective fire dynamic scenarios while minimizing exposure to hazardous conditions and materials.</p><p>Using data generated with Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) - a world class heat and smoke transport simulation package written by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) of the United States Department of Commerce - driving a visually realistic room-scale VR simulation, end users will be able to train with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashover">flashover</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backdraft">backdraft</a> scenarios that currently are only experienced at active fire scenes at great risk to the firefighter.</p> <p><img src="/img/fds_snapshot_33.png" /></p>'
